## Lab 04 – Compiling C Programs and Applied Problem Solving

This lab focuses on compiling C programs from the command line, managing source files across directories, and implementing a complete problem-solving program using fundamental C constructs.

### Key Topics
- Navigating directories and copying files using shell commands
- Compiling C programs with compiler warnings enabled
- Writing and executing C programs using loops and user input
- Capturing program output for verification
- Translating a real-world problem into a computational model

### Tasks Completed
- Copied a C source file from a parent directory and compiled it into an executable using a single command sequence
- Implemented and executed a temperature conversion program using a `while` loop
- Designed and implemented a C program to compute expected wildlife roadkill based on user input and given constants
- Ran programs and recorded output to demonstrate correctness

### Files
- `MakeTheTicker.txt` – Command sequence used to copy and compile `Ticker.c`
- `FahrCelciusWhile.c` – Source code for the temperature conversion program
- `FahrCelciusWhile.out` – Output from running the temperature conversion program
- C source file implementing the roadkill estimation calculation

This lab reinforces practical C programming skills and emphasizes applying basic language constructs to solve
