<HR><!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<P>
Write a signal sender and receiver pair of programs.
<P>
The sender program (1.5%) must:
<OL>
<LI> Set up a function that handles <TT>SIGINT</TT> signals.
     This function must:
     <OL>
     <LI> Print a message.
     <LI> Reset the alarm for 5 seconds later.
     <LI> Send a <TT>SIGUSR1</TT> to the receiver process.
     </OL>
<LI> Set up a function that handles <TT>SIGALRM</TT> signals.
     The function must:
     <OL>
     <LI> Increment the global counter of the number of <TT>SIGALRM</TT>s handled.
     <LI> Print a message saying how many alarms have been handled.
     <LI> Reset the alarm for 5 seconds later.
     </OL>
<LI> Set a global counter of the number of <TT>SIGALRM</TT>s handled to 0.
<LI> Fork off a child process to run the receiver program.
<LI> Set a <TT>SIGALRM</TT> for 5 seconds later.
<LI> Run a loop containing a <TT>pause()</TT> call until 3 <TT>SIGALRM</TT>s have been handled.
<LI> Turn off the alarm
<LI> Send a <TT>SIGKILL</TT> signal to the child process.
<LI> Clean up the zombie of the child process.
</OL>
Each time the alarm goes off the sender gets closer to termination (of the while loop).
A <TT>SIGINT</TT> (generated by ^C on the keyboard) saves the program from an impending alarm.  
<P></P>
The receiver program (0.5%) must:
<OL>
<LI> Arrange to ignore <TT>SIGINT</TT> signals.
<LI> Set up a function that handles <TT>SIGUSR1</TT> signals.
     This function must:
     <OL>
     <LI> Print a message.
     </OL>
<LI> Run an infinite loop containing a <TT>pause()</TT> call.
</OL>

A sample run look like this:
<PRE>
SignalSender just got alarm 1
^CSignalSender just got an interrupt
SignalReceiver just got an SIGUSR1
^CSignalSender just got an interrupt
SignalReceiver just got an SIGUSR1
SignalSender just got alarm 2
^CSignalSender just got an interrupt
SignalReceiver just got an SIGUSR1
SignalSender just got alarm 3
</PRE>
