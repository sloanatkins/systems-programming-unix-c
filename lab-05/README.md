## Lab 05 – Modular C Programming and Applied Calculations

This lab focuses on writing well-structured C programs that perform non-trivial calculations based on user input. Emphasis is placed on using functions appropriately, following a provided design, and producing correct, well-formatted output.

### Key Topics
- Modular program design using multiple C functions
- User input validation and numeric computation
- Translating real-world problems into precise algorithms
- Conditional logic and categorization
- Following a predefined structure chart and algorithm

### Programs Implemented

#### SCUBAO2.c – Nitrox Dive Safety Calculator
This program computes safety-related values for SCUBA dives using Nitrox gas mixtures.

**Features:**
- Calculates ambient pressure based on dive depth
- Computes partial pressure of oxygen
- Determines an oxygen pressure group based on defined ranges
- Reports whether recommended and contingency oxygen pressure limits are exceeded
- Uses functions to separate calculation and decision logic

This program reinforces careful numeric computation and conditional evaluation in C.

#### GeoffsIRS.c – Simplified Tax Calculation Program
This program computes income tax based on a sequence of income and deduction inputs, following a specified design and structure chart.

**Features:**
- Repeatedly accepts income and deduction values until termination
- Computes taxable income with boundary conditions
- Determines a tax group based on income thresholds
- Calculates tax owed using group-specific rates and a maximum cap
- Outputs formatted tax information
- Implements all internal nodes of the structure chart as separate functions

This program emphasizes disciplined program structure and faithful implementation of a given algorithm.
