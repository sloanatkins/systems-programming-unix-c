## Lab 03 – Shell Editing, Job Control, and Pipelines

This lab focuses on interactive UNIX usage, including text editing, job control, globbing, and command pipelines. The tasks emphasize precise command construction and understanding how the shell manages processes and input/output.

### Key Topics
- Editing files using terminal-based editors (`vi` or `emacs`)
- File creation and globbing patterns in the shell
- Compiling C programs from the command line
- Foreground and background process control
- Suspending, resuming, and terminating jobs
- Constructing pipelines using `head`, `tail`, and `grep`
- Pattern matching with regular expressions

### Tasks Completed
- Created a command reference file documenting required shell commands
- Used globbing to match filenames with specific character constraints
- Compiled and executed a C program while managing multiple jobs
- Practiced suspending, resuming, and killing processes via job control
- Built a pipeline to extract specific course codes from a tex
