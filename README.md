# Systems Programming in UNIX with C

This repository contains systems programming coursework implemented in C on UNIX-based systems. The work focuses on low-level programming concepts, operating system interfaces, and UNIX development tools.

## Course Context
**CSC 322 – System Programming**  
This course covers programming in a UNIX environment, including shell usage, scripting, file systems, and development tools. In C, topics include pointers, libraries, system calls, processes, threads, signals, and file system interfaces.

## Topics & Skills
- C programming for UNIX systems
- Pointers, memory, and low-level data handling
- UNIX system calls and libraries
- Processes, threads, and signals
- File system interaction
- Shell scripting and Makefiles
- Debugging and command-line tooling

## Repository Structure
- `/lab-01` – `/lab-13` – Progressive lab assignments covering UNIX and C fundamentals
- `/project-01`, `/project-02` – Larger systems programming projects
- `/tests` – Final Exam program

## Notes
This repository emphasizes correctness, low-level understanding, and practical interaction with the UNIX operating system rather than high-level application development.
