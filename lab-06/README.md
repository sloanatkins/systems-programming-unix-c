## Lab 06 – Makefiles and Version Control with Git

This lab focuses on building multi-file C programs using Makefiles and practicing version control workflows using Git and GitHub. Emphasis is placed on automation, correctness, and following prescribed development processes.

### Key Topics
- Writing Makefiles for multi-file C projects
- Compiler warnings and optimization flags
- Dependency management using object files
- Cleaning build artifacts
- Git repository initialization and configuration
- Branching, merging, and commit history
- Synchronizing local repositories with GitHub

---

### Tasks Completed

#### Makefile Development
- Created a Makefile to build a multi-file C program consisting of custom headers and implementations
- Enabled full compiler warnings using `-Wall`
- Optimized the final executable using `-O6`
- Used variable definitions for source and object files
- Leveraged default rules for object file compilation
- Implemented a `clean` target to remove generated object files

#### Git and GitHub Workflow
- Initialized a local Git repository and connected it to a public GitHub repository
- Tracked file changes using commits and pushes
- Created and worked with branches
- Merged branches back into the main branch
- Verified repository history using Git logs and GitHub network visualization

---

### Files
- `Makefile` – Build automation file for the NameAge program
- `GittingAlong.txt` – Terminal commands used throughout the Git workflow
- `GitLog.txt` – Output of `git log --all --graph`
- `GitLog.png` – Screenshot of the GitHub network graph
- `HelloWorld.c` – Source file used for Git exercises

This lab reinforces professional development practices including build automation and disciplined version control, both of which are essential for systems programming and collaborative software development.
