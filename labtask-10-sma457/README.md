Write a program that reads a file of commands and executes them all in "background mode".
The file name is given as a command line argument.
The lines in the file contain the program name and its parameters (you need to sort out the 
parameters from the command).
This batch process starter must wait for all the programs to finish before it exits.
<P>
A sample file that could be presented to your program contains:
<PRE>
date
ls -l
sleep 1
cat fred.c
