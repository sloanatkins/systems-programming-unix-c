## Lab 02 – UNIX Files, Links, and Permissions

This lab focuses on navigating the UNIX file system, working with file extensions via shell scripting, and understanding links and permissions at the operating system level.

### Key Topics
- Locating system files and directories using the command line
- Understanding standard UNIX paths (e.g. compilers, group files, spool directories)
- Writing shell scripts with argument validation
- Batch file renaming using file extensions
- Creating and distinguishing hard links vs. symbolic (soft) links
- Managing file and directory permissions using UNIX permission bits

### Tasks Completed
- Identified and recorded absolute paths to key system files and directories
- Implemented a shell script to safely rename file extensions with error handling
- Created directories and files programmatically from the command line
- Built both hard and symbolic links and documented the commands used
- Set directory permissions to specified access levels for owner, group, and others

### Files
- `Eureka.txt` – Absolute paths to required system files and directories
- `ChangeExtensions.sh` – Shell script for renaming file extensions with validation
- `MakingLinks.txt` – Commands used to create directories, files, and links
- `Permissions.txt` – Commands used to set directory permission
